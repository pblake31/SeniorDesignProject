# SeniorDesignProject
This repository represents my Electrical Engineering Senior Design Project from (2022/2023)
The associated files make up the web server that I created to view electronic component inventory, and to automatically dispense components from our Smart SMD Feeder using MQTT protocol. They are stored on a raspberry pi that uses Apache Web Server to host the website.

index.html is the home page
database.php is the page that displays data from a mySQL database
dispense.php is the page used to dispense components
dataChanger.php is the page that allows the user to edit the database
style.css is the styling for all the pages
update.php is the file that allows the the database to be updated through an http request
